# HadGEM3-ERF-Timeseries

This repository contains the global-annual-mean historical (1850-2014) ERF timeseries simulated by HadGEM3-GC3.1-LL as described in Andrews et al. (2019, see below).

## Data description

ERF is calculated as the difference in net TOA radiative flux between the RFMIP `piClim-histall` and `piClim-control` HadGEM3-GC3.1-LL experiments.  The global-annual-mean data runs from 1850-2014 inclusive.  Fluxes are positive downards.  Details are given in Andrews et al. (2019).  The data is the black line in Figure 7a of Andrews et al. (2019).

## Data files

The data files have been produced using `idl_write_data.pro`.
